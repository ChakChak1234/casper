# Vendor modules

This folder contains third party libraries or lua scripts that are not
available via luarocks.

## json.lua
This module was takes from http://regex.info/code/JSON.lua. The reference
website can be found at http://regex.info/blog/lua/json.

This module is not on luarocks or any other public repo AFAICT, so I just
ended up copying it in our repo.
